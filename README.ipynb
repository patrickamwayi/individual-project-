    "There is concern by banks why customers move from one bank to another. In this regard we need to understand which aspects of service influence customer's decisions to leave. And with this case study, bank management can concentrate their efforts to improve their services to retain customers.\n",
    "### Business understanding\n",
    "The goal of this project is to identify key drivers of customer churn and build a neutral model that accurately determine whether they will leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data understanding\n",
    "The bank customer churn data was obtained from Kaggle open-source dataset. It is stored in a csv file, named as \"Bank Customer Churn Prediction.csv\". It has 12 columns called features, including 10000 row numbers. The fetures are customer id, credit score, country, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products purchased through the bank, whether customer has a credit card, whether customer is an active member, estimated salary, and whether customer left the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepare data\n",
    "For categorical data features country and gender was handled by encoding. After checking the missing values in the dataset, it showed no missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EDA, modeling\n",
    "Divided whole dataset into training data and test data.\n",
    "The overall churn rate is 20%.\n",
    "I explored the correlation between every features and churn outcome.\n",
    "I built three machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest and Logistic Regression) to predict the customer churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluate the results\n",
    "Evaluated the predictions with accuracy and confusion matrix.\n",

    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "- Customer churn prediction is important to a long-term financial stability of banks. In this project, I successfully created a machine learning model - Decision Tree Classifier that was able to predict customer churn with an accuracy of 81% performing 2 percent better than the baseline's 79%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can conclude that of all the features age, country, gender and balance had a impact on customer churn.\n",
    "- Age: Customers at age 30-40 considered as the young are more likely to churn than oder ones, it is also this age bracket that has less than 600 credit score.\n",
    "- Country: Germany has the highest churn rate compared to other countries Spain and France.\n",
    "- Gender: Female customers are easier to churn than male customers.\n",
    "- Balance: Customers with high balances are more likely to churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations:\n",
    "- Age: We can see that younger customers are more likely to leave a bank because they are uneducated on building good credit and wealth. Banks should come up with loyalty and retention programs aimed at customers who can still be saved especially customers with poor credit scores given their age, or anyone with a credit score below 600.\n",
    "- Gender: Since banks are losing more female customers, they need to allocate more resources into pursuing female-oriented promotions such as offering rewards cards and points. Our data evidently shows female are likely to leave because they are bigger spenders and will tend to spend a lot to keep their lifestyles. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- My next step would be to find out how much did our y variable change over the period of 2 years to acquire the right information to do another research.\n",
    "- I would also like to do a research on Country - Germany and find out why it has the highest churn compared to the rest. Is it because of policies? Do banks have heavy competition?\n",
    "- I would recommend that in the future we research on age and find out why middle age adult are leaving and find ways to retain them.\n",
    "- Finally, I would love to check if my recommendations had an impact on our future data.\n",
